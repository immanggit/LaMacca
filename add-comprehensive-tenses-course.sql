            'text', 'The Present Simple tense is one of the most fundamental tenses in English. We use it to talk about facts, habits, routines, and general truths. The structure is straightforward: for most subjects (I, you, we, they), we use the base form of the verb. For third-person singular subjects (he, she, it), we add -s or -es to the base form. For example: "I work" but "She works."

For negative sentences, we use the auxiliary verb "do" or "does" with "not" followed by the base form of the verb: "I do not (don''t) work" or "She does not (doesn''t) work."

For questions, we place "do" or "does" before the subject: "Do you work?" or "Does she work?"

The Present Simple has several key uses:
1. Expressing habits or routines: "I exercise every morning."
2. Stating facts or general truths: "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius."
3. Describing permanent situations: "She lives in London."
4. Following a schedule: "The train leaves at 9 PM."
5. Giving instructions or directions: "First, you turn right at the corner."
6. Expressing feelings and opinions: "I think this is correct."

Time expressions commonly used with the Present Simple include: always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never, every day/week/month/year, on Mondays, in the morning, at night, etc.

Remember that with the verbs "have," "do," and some forms of "be," the structure can be slightly different. For example, we can say "I have a car" (not "I do have a car") in positive statements.',

            'text', 'The Past Continuous tense (also called Past Progressive) is used to talk about actions or situations that were in progress at a specific time in the past. We form it using was/were + verb-ing. Use "was" with I, he, she, it and "were" with you, we, they. For example: "I was reading when you called." 

We use Past Continuous for several purposes:
1. Actions in progress at a specific time in the past: "At 8 PM yesterday, I was having dinner."
2. Actions in progress when another action interrupted: "I was watching TV when the phone rang."
3. Two actions in progress at the same time: "While I was cooking, my wife was setting the table."
4. To describe the background in a story: "It was raining, and the wind was blowing strongly."
5. For repeated actions that were annoying or irritating in the past: "He was always leaving his dirty clothes on the floor."

The Past Continuous emphasizes the process or duration of an action, not its completion. It creates a sense of being in the middle of an action when something else happened.

To form negative sentences, we add "not" after was/were: "She was not (wasn''t) sleeping." For questions, we put was/were before the subject: "Were they working late?"

Time expressions commonly used with Past Continuous include: at that time, at this time yesterday, at 8 PM last night, when, while, as, all morning/day/night, etc.

Remember that stative verbs (like know, believe, want, etc.) are not usually used in continuous forms. For example, we say "I knew the answer" (not "I was knowing the answer").',
